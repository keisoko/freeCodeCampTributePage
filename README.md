# freeCodeCampTributePage

My first freeCodeCamp project.

This is the Russian author Mikhail Bulgakov tribute page, created as a project for the freeCodeCamp.

The direction of the project are as follows:

    Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/NNvBQW/.

    Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries you need. Give it your own personal style.
    
    User Story: I can view a tribute page with an image and text.
    
    User Story: I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.
   

I am still learning. I love anime and sci-fi and fantasy audiobooks.
