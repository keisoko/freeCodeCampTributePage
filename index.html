                        <br/>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>1891</strong> - born in Kiev, Ukraine.</li>
                            <li><strong>1901</strong> - Bulgakov joined the First Kiev Gymnasium, where he developed an 
                            interest in Russian and European literature, theater and opera.</li>
                            <li><strong>1909</strong> - Graduates from the Gymnasium and enters the Medical Facility of Kiev 
                            University, which he finished with commendation. He then took position with as a physician at the 
                            Kiev Military hospital.</li>
                            <li><strong>1913</strong> - Bulgakov married Tatiana Lappa. At the outbreak of the First World War, 
                            he volunteered with Red Cross as a medical doctor and was sent directly to the front, where he was 
                            badly injured at least twice.</li>
                            <li><strong>1916</strong> - Bulgakov graduates from the Medical Department of Kiev University and 
                            after serving as a surgeon at Chernovtsy hospital, was appointed provincial physician to Smolensk 
                            province. His life in those days is reflected in his <em>A Country Doctor Notebook.</em></li>
                            <li><strong>September 1917</strong> - Bulgakov was moved to the hospital in Vyazma, near 
                            Smolensk.</li>
                            <li><strong>February 1918</strong> - He returned to Kiev, Ukraine, where he opened a private 
                            practice at his home at Andreyevsky Descent, 13. Here he lived through the Russian Civil War and 
                            witnessed ten coups.</li>
                            <li><strong>1919</strong> - In February of that year, Bulgakov was mobilized as an army physician by 
                            the Ukrainian People's Army and assigned to the Northern Caucasus. There, he became seriously ill 
                            with typhus and barely survived. After illness Bulgakov abandoned his career is doctor for that of a 
                            writer. Later that year, he writes and publishes his first book called <em>Future Perspective</em>, 
                            which was an almanac of feuilletons. In December 1919, Bulgakov moves to the Vladikavkaz where he 
                            wrote and saw his first two plays, <em>Self Defense</em> and <em>The Turbin Brothers</em>, being 
                            produced for the city theater stage with great success.</li>
                            <li><strong>1921</strong> - In September of that year, Bulgakov and his wife settled near 
                            Patriarch's Ponds, close to Mayakovskaya metro station on Bolshaya Sadovaya Street, 10, Moscow. To 
                            make a living, he started working as a correspondent and feuilletons writer for the newspapers 
                            <em>Gudok</em>, <em>Krasnaia Panorama</em> and <em>Nakanune</em>, based in Berlin.  For the almanac 
                            <em>Nedra</em>, he wrote <em>Diaboliad</em>, <em>The Fatal Eggs (1924)</em>, and <em>Heart of 
                            a Dog (1925)</em>, works that combined bitter satire and elements of science fiction and 
                            were concerned with the fate of a scientist and the misuse of his discovery.</li>
                            <li><strong>1922 - 1926</strong> - Bulgakov wrote several plays ( including <em>Zoyka's 
                            Apartment</em> ), none of which where allowed into production at the time. <em>The Run</em>, 
                            treating the horrors of a fratricidal war, was personally banned by Joseph Stalin after the 
                            Glavrepertkom (Department of Repertoire) decided that it "glorified emigration and White 
                            generals".</li>
                            <li><strong>1925</strong> - Bulgakov divorced his first wife and married Lyubov Belozerskaya. This 
                            year also saw first partial publication of <em>The White Guard</em> in serial form in Soviet-era 
                            literary journal <em>Rossiya</em>, but the magazine was closed before the serial was completed. It 
                            was not reprinted in Russia until 1966. <em>The White Guard</em> depicts a life of White Army 
                            officer's family in civil war Kiev.</li>
                            <li><strong>1926</strong> - After the first two parts of The White Guard were published in Rossiya, 
                            Bulgakov was invited to write a version for the stage. He called the play <em>The Days of the 
                            Turbins</em>. This was produced at Moscow Art Theater, to great acclaim. The production ran from 
                            1926 to 1941. Stalin saw it no fewer than 20 times.</li>
                            <li><strong>1928</strong> - Bulgakov began writing his masterpiece: <em>Master and Margarita</em>, 
                            which has not been published until 1966 by his widow. The book contributed a number of sayings to 
                            the Russian language, for example, "Manuscripts don't burn" and "second-grade freshness". A 
                            destroyed manuscript of the Master is an important element of the plot. Bulgakov had to rewrite the 
                            novel from memory after he burned the draft manuscript. The novel is a critique of Soviet society 
                            and its literary establishment. The work is appreciated for its philosophical undertones and for 
                            its high artistic level thanks to its picturesque descriptions (especially of old Jerusalem), 
                            lyrical fragments and style. It is a frame narrative involving two characteristically related time 
                            periods, or plot lines: a retelling of the gospels and a description of contemporary Moscow.</li>
                            <li><strong>1932</strong> - Bulgakov married for the third time, to Yelena Shilovskaya, who would 
                            prove to be inspiration for the character Margarita in <em>Master and Margarita</em>. During the 
                            last decade of his life, Bulgakov continued to work on <em>The Master and Margarita</em>, wrote 
                            plays, critical works, stories, and made several translations and dramatizations of novels, 
                            librettos. Many of them were not published, other ones were "torn to pieces" by critics. Much of 
                            his work (ridiculing the Soviet system) stayed in his desk drawer for several decades.</li>
                            <li><strong>late 1930s</strong> - He joined Bolshoi Theater as a librettist and consultant. He left 
                            after perceiving that none of his works would be produced there. Stalin's favor protected Bulgakov 
                            from arrests and execution, but he could not get his writing published. His novels and dramas were 
                            subsequently banned and, for the second time, Bulgakov's career as playwright was ruined. When his 
                            last play <em>Batum</em> (1939), a complimentary portrayal of Stalin's early revolutionary days, was 
                            banned before rehearsals, Bulgakov requested permission to leave the country but was refused.</li>
                            <li><strong>1939</strong> - Mikhail Bulgakov organized a private reading of <em>The Master and Margarita</em> 
                            to his close circle of friends. Yelena Bulgakova remembered 30 years later, "When he finally 
                            finished reading that night, he said: 'Well, tomorrow I am taking the novel to the publisher!' and 
                            everyone was silent", "...Everyone sat paralyzed. Everything scared them. P. (P. A. Markov, 
                            in charge of the literature division of MAT) later at the door fearfully tried to explain to me that 
                            trying to publish the novel would cause terrible things", she wrote in her diary (14 May 1939)</li>
                            <li><strong>March 10, 1940</strong> - Mikhail Bulgakov died from nephrosclerosis (an inherited 
                            kidney disorder). He was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. His father had died of the 
                            same disease, and from his youth Bulgakov had guessed his future mortal diagnosis.</li>
